# RecipeApp
Personal project recipe app so I can explore AWS as well as mobile development.

## Project goals:
  1. Have a mobile app I can run on my android that manages a recipe book.
  2. I can add/remove recipes.
  3. When it's time to go to a grocery store, I can select what recipes I want to shop for and then all their ingredients are coalesced into one list, where I can check off things in my cart.
  4. Recipes are categorized, such that I don't have to double back all over the grocery store.
  5. Cloud hosted-data, using Serverless AWS resources (DynamoDB, Lambda, Cognito)
  6. Support for multiple users with different recipe lists. Recipes can be shared between users by specifying an email you want to share it with.
